      <h3>About the Game</h3>
      <p>
        Animal Olympics is a game for between 3 and 8 players - the animals' coaches. The three
        disciplines are being picked randomly from the different categories aswell as the weather
        condition and you choose one animal from your selection (***<em>work in progress</em>***) of
        animals. That one animal athlete will compete in all three events of the Triathlon! Each
        beast has its strengths and weaknesses, making it ideal for certain events but comically
        awful at others. Convice the contrahents of why your animal will be the best in a certain
        discipline. At the end of each discussion you vote - you rate the strategy of the others
        (***<em>only once: work in progress :) </em>***) and a winner is being established at the
        end of the triathlon. The dolphin is competing in the Long Jumps? There will be water lanes
        provided of course. The walrus is competing against the squirrel in the paintballing event?
        No worries, the guns will be appropriately-sized for each animal. (***
        <em>More infos - especially on each of the disciplines - to follow soon.</em>***)
